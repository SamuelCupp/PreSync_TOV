# PreSync-TOV
This repository implements PreSync with the TOV example from the Einstein Toolkit. It is currently in progress.

Included is a new Boundary thorn. It is currently labeled Boundary2 to prevent compilation conflicts,
as it is not backwards compatible in its current form. Currently, essential thorns require Boundary, so both
must be included in the thornlist. However, future changes to these thorns should remove this unnecessary requirement.
